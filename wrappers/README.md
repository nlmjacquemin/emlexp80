# ðŸ§° Wrappers

This folder contains all the tool-specific scripts that define **how each software is executed inside its container** in the `emlexp80` pipeline. These wrappers handle command-line options, file handling, and tool logic, and are intended to be executed via the `apptainer.sh` runner script.

Each wrapper is paired with:

-   A corresponding container image (built from `dockerfiles/`)
-   A SLURM `submitter` script that schedules its execution

---

## ðŸ§± Role in the Pipeline

-   Wrappers **do not execute directly**: they are invoked through `apptainer.sh`, which takes care of container loading and runtime environment setup.
-   Each wrapper accepts parameters such as `--working_directory`, `--input_folder`, or `--threads`, and handles input/output paths relative to the project folder.
-   Tool-specific logic such as paired-end file detection or format validation is handled here.
